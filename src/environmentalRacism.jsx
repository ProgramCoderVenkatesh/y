        <p id='first-content'>Environmental racism has plagued communities of color for decades.</p>
        <p>Pollution, climate change, and more have stripped from these communities the right to their most basic needs: clean water, food, air, and safe housing.</p>

        <h2 id='second-content'>What are some environmental injustices?</h2>
        <p>Air pollution:This 2018 study found that communities living below the poverty line have a 35 percent higher burden from particulate matter emissions than the overall population. Non-whites had a 28 percent higher health burden and African Americans, specifically, had a 54 percent higher burden than the overall population.</p>
        <p>Chemical waste: People of color make up nearly half the population in fence-line zones – areas closest to hazardous chemical facilities. They are almost twice as likely as whites to live near dangerous chemical plants.</p>
        <p>Chemical facilities in communities of color have almost twice the rate of incidents compared to those in predominately white neighborhoods – one incident per six facilities compared to one incident per 11 facilities.</p>
        <p>Lead exposure: Although childhood lead exposure in the United States is decreasing, children of color are still disproportionately affected by lead poisoning, according to the CDC.</p>
        <p>Water contamination: Concerns about drinking water contamination among minority groups have been reported since the 1950s. Water quality is certainly still an issue today; for example, people of the Navajo Nation have dealt with water contamination since the 1950s uranium mining of the region, as well as the Gold King Mine wastewater spill in 2015. Today, one in three homes in the Navajo Nation do not have a tap or a toilet.</p>
        <p>1. Water quality can be affected by a host of different toxic chemicals or metals. For example, lead leached from aging pipes can pollute the drinking water. Flint, Michigan, has been dealing with community lead poisoning since 2014. More than half of Flint's population is people of color.</p>
        <p>2. A few major cities across the country such as Detroit, Pittsburgh, Newark, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh struggle with select toxics in their tap water.</p>
        <p>Climate change: The effects of climate change, such as extreme weather conditions, can have devastating impacts on low-income communities. Extreme weather can displace residents that lack a safe place to go or the capacity to rebuild, and even cause death, especially if housing is old or inadequately built.</p>
        <p>1. Hurricane Katrina was devastating to New Orleans' African American community. Racial discrimination had pushed Black communities to the outskirts of the city; these were communities most impacted when the levees failed and are systematically neglected by local government. By 2013, about 80 percent of the mostly Black residents of the city's Lower 9th Ward had not returned to their community due to inadequate rebuilding efforts.</p>

        <h2 id='third-content'>What are the impacts of environmental injustice?</h2>
        <p>Environmental injustices contribute to disparities in health status among populations of different race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Due to disproportionate exposure to contaminated air, water, toxic chemicals, unsafe workplaces, and other environmental hazards, poor, disenfranchised, and minority communities face more health problems. Children, due to their developing state and age-related exposure patterns, are most at risk.</p>
        <p>Health problems proven to correlate with environmental setting include:</p>
        <p>1. Asthma</p>
        <p>2. Obesity</p>
        <p>3. Lead poisoning</p>
        <p>4. Lung cancer</p>
        <p>5. Diabetes</p>
        <p>5. Mental health and developmental problems</p>
        <p>As if health issues were not enough, the impact of environmental neglect compounds on itself and leaves these vulnerable communities facing further challenges, including:</p>
        <p>1. Inadequate access to healthcare and preventative care</p>
        <p>2. Lack of access to healthful foods</p>
        <p>3. Lack of safe play spaces for children</p>
        <p>4. Absence of good jobs</p>
        <p>5. Heightened crime, violence, and police brutality</p>
        <p>6. Voter suppression and systematic disenfranchisement</p>
        <p>6.1 Barriers to register</p>
        <p>6.2 Lack of access to polling stations</p>
        <p>6.3 Health problems tend to depress voter turnout</p>
        <div className='image-box'><img src="../src/assets/image/environmentalRacism3.jpg" alt="" height={400} width={750} /></div>
        <p>The Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 demonstrate a cry for justice from a faction of our society that is systematically oppressed, discriminated against, and ignored. Movements such as BLM tie into the Environmental Justice movement: race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status should not affect one's right to a healthy environment and accompanying issues.</p>
