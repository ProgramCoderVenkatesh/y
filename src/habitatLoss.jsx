        <p id='first-content'>Habitat loss refers to the reduction in the amount of space where a particular species, or group of species can survive and reproduce.  Habitat loss is a consequence of human activities such as agriculture, urbanization, deforestation, resource extraction, alteration of the sea-floor due to trawling (fishing), or the release of pollutants. Habitat loss can also occur due to environmental changes, such as volcanic eruptions or tsunamis, or changes in climate or sea level, which today are largely the result of human activities.  Habitat loss can decrease biodiversity and alters species ranges and interactions.</p>
        <p>Humans have altered Earth’s land for thousands of years, but industrialization and population growth over the last 300 years, and especially over the last 70 years, has led to a great expansion in our land use and disturbance of habitats worldwide.</p>
        <p>Habitat restoration is the purposeful rehabilitation of an area to recreate a functioning ecosystem. Successful habitat restoration requires understanding species life cycles and interactions, and the food, water, nutrients, space, and shelter that is necessary to sustain species populations. When habitats cannot be restored to their original size or condition, land can be set aside that connects open spaces and habitats, called wildlife corridors, that allow species to survive in and around areas occupied by humans. For example, marshes are important resting spots for migratory birds, bridges allow animals to cross highways, and protected creek habitats create space for plants and animals even within developed areas.</p>

        <h2 id='second-content'>Major Kinds of Habitat Loss</h2>
        <p><span style={{fontSize: 19, fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Habitat destruction:</span> A bulldozer pushing down trees is the iconic image of habitat destruction. Other ways people directly destroy habitat include filling in wetlands, dredging rivers, mowing fields, and cutting down trees.</p>
        <p><span style={{fontSize: 19, fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Habitat fragmentation:</span> Much of the remaining terrestrial wildlife habitat in the U.S. has been cut up into fragments by roads and development. Aquatic species’ habitats have been fragmented by dams and water diversions. These fragments of habitat may not be large or connected enough to support species that need a large territory where they can find mates and food. The loss and fragmentation of habitats makes it difficult for migratory species to find places to rest and feed along their migration routes.</p>
        <p><span style={{fontSize: 19, fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Habitat degradation:</span> Pollution, invasive species, and disruption of ecosystem processes (such as changing the intensity of fires in an ecosystem) are some of the ways habitats can become so degraded, they no longer support native wildlife.</p>

        <h2 id='third-content'>Main Causes of Habitat Loss</h2>
        <p><span style={{fontSize: 19, fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Agriculture:</span> Much of the habitat loss from agriculture was done long ago when settlers converted forests and prairies to cropland. Today, there is increasing pressure to redevelop conservation lands for high-priced food and biofuel crops.</p>
        <p><span style={{fontSize: 19, fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Land conversion for development:</span> The conversion of lands that once provided wildlife habitat to housing developments, roads, office parks, strip malls, parking lots and industrial sites continues, even during the current economic crisis.</p>
        <p><span style={{fontSize: 19, fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Water development:</span> Dams and other water diversions siphon off and disconnect waters, changing hydrology and water chemistry (when nutrients are not able to flow downstream). During the dry season, the Colorado River has little to no water in it by the time it reaches the Sea of Cortez.</p>
        <p><span style={{fontSize: 19, fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Pollution:</span> Freshwater wildlife are most impacted by pollution. Pollutants such as untreated sewage, mining waste, acid rain, fertilizers and pesticides concentrate in rivers, lakes and wetlands and eventually end up in estuaries and the food web.</p>
        <p><span style={{fontSize: 19, fontWeight: 'bold'}}>Climate change:</span> The emerging driver of habitat loss is climate change. Wildlife that need the cool temperatures of high elevations, such as the American pika, may soon run out of habitat. Coastal wildlife may find their habitat underwater as sea levels rise.</p>
